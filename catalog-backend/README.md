I encountered an issue while generating the downloadable file. Let me try again to ensure the file is correctly created.

It seems there is an issue creating the downloadable file directly. Let me provide you the **README content**, which you can copy into a `README.md` file manually.

# Express Catalog Management API

This project is a backend service for managing catalogs, built with Express and TypeScript. It connects to a MongoDB database and provides CRUD operations for catalog management.

## Features

- Add, edit, delete, and retrieve catalogs.
- Automatic handling of `isPrimary` field to ensure only one primary catalog per vertical.
- Validation of fields like `name`, `vertical`, and `locales`.
- Configurable via `.env` file for environment variables.
- Scheduled automated indexing with cron-like functionality.
- Middleware for JSON parsing and CORS.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) running locally or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/catalogDB
   PORT=3033
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
